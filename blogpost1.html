            First Year Course Review

            As a first year at UTM in the CS program you have to deal with this <i>little</i> hurdle known as POSt (Program of Study). This is essentially a secondary admissions process
            as first years at the University of Toronto are not actually in any major yet (in most cases). What this entails is a set of course and grade requirements that a student must meet
            in their first year in order to then apply, and hopefully be accepted into their desired program. The requirements for admission into the Computer Science major and specialist programs 
            especially, are infamous here but thankfully those have been made a fair bit most reasonable at 2 of the 3 campuses. At UTM, we still don't have a proper in-stream/out-of-stream system 
            which results in the requirements being the <b>exact</b> same whether a student is in the CS stream or not. The requirements for first round CS POSt in my year (May 2024) were as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>80% in CSC148</li>
                <li>80% in MAT102</li>
                <li>Completion of one of the first year calculus course pairs</li>
                <li>Completion of ISP100</li>
                <li>A cumulative grade point average of 3.3</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, to even be able to apply for a program of study, a student must have completed atleast 4 credits (8 half year courses). I am of the opinion that making POSt is very feasible, even for the average student.
            Below, I will give my thoughts on the two required POSt courses and the strategies I used to succeed in them.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>MAT102</li>
                <li>CSC148</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <div class="b1MAT102">

            <h2>MAT102</h2>

                This course is infamous for being <b>THE</b> make or break course for POSt and it's easy to see why this is. First of all, the math taught in this course is 
                very different from the math that most people know up to this point. The key to succeeding in this course is to first really learn the language of math (what
                 does an implication mean? how do set inclusions work?). Then is to fully understand each topic or technique being taught, what each technique is used for, what conditions
                 must be met before using it, how each technique works in a logical sense. It is pretty important to master each technique, or atleast become comfortably acquainted with them
                 as these topics will come up time and time again throughout your time here (for example, CSC236 is LITERALLY all about induction).
